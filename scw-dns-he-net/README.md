# scw-dns-he-net

This script will update A or AAAA records on dns.he.net using the server's
metadata. Update will only be send if the A or AAAA records differ from the
IPv4 or IPv6 address reported by the server's metadata. DNS queries are by
default made to he.net's nameservers to ensure that the most up to date
record is being fetch and not scaleway's dns cache.

# Configuration

The configuration file must be copied to the /etc directory and with the
same name as this script, but with the extension change to .conf (IE, if
your script is renamed to 'fixmydns', the configuration file will be
'/etc/fixmydns.conf')

The configuration file consist of the DEFAULT section, and various server
definition sections.

```
[DEFAULT]
scwMetaData = /usr/local/bin/scw-metadata-json
nameServers = ns1.he.net ns2.he.net ns3.he.net ns4.he.net ns5.he.net
```

The default section and any of it's parameters are optionnals. If is used to
override defaults parameters of the scripts. `scwMetaData` let you specify a
different executable that will be used to retreive the server's metadata and
`nameServers` let you specify other nameservers than he.net's to validate if
your ip has change from the DNS records.

```
[server1.domain.com]
Key = <ddns update key>
IPv4 = True
IPv6 = True
```

All other sections should be name exactly like the A or AAAA record you want
to update. 'Key' must be set to your ddns update key, 'IPv4' must be set to
true to update the A record and 'IPv6' to update the AAAA record.

# Logging

Logging is done with syslog entries.

# Startup script

Create a one-shot systemd unit named '/etc/systemd/system/scw-dns-he-net.service'

```
[Unit]
Description=Update dns.he.net entries at startup

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/scw-dns-he-net
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then run the following commands to activate the one-shot script at startup:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable scw-dns-he-net.service
```
